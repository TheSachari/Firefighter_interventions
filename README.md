# Firefighter Intervention Simulator and Decision Making Agent

Examples of how to use the code are displayed [here](Examples.ipynb)

## Train

How to train the intervention generator. Code is based on the excellent work from [Akim Kotelnikov](https://github.com/yandex-research/tab-ddpm/blob/main/LICENSE.md) under MIT licence.

## Sample

How to create fake interventions. Code is based on the excellent work from [Akim Kotelnikov](https://github.com/yandex-research/tab-ddpm/blob/main/LICENSE.md) under MIT licence.

## Generate environment

Generates the environment for the simulation.

## Metrics

Evaluated metrics and their associated rewards. Feel free to explore with new values.

## Simulation

Firefighters response simulation. 2 logics: best skilled firefighter or random skilled firefighter is selected

## Agent params

Hyperparameters for the Agent.

## Agent models

2 models are implemented: Rainbow DQN and FQF. Code is based on the excellent work from [Sebastian Dittert](https://github.com/BY571).  

The Munchausen RL as well as Intrinsic Curiosity are also implemented for both DQN and FQF. Code is based on the excellent work from [Sebastian Dittert](https://github.com/BY571)

## Stats
